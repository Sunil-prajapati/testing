npm run test fileName(for run specific file)
describe.only to run specific testCase from group
describe.skip to skip specific testCase from group
we can also make nested describe 
fireEvent for onChange
if we create a folder with __test__ name then we don't need to write name like "button.test.tsx"
before(before test case running) and after(after test case ran) hooks
beforeAll and beforeEach same for after
snapshot testing before going for PROD (basically we run through the root od the app to match with existing snapshot)
we have to do snapshot shot testing when it's ready to deploy on PROD
press u to update existing snapshot 
we don't need to write test case for all of the code
    must things to test below:-
    Testing component 
    UI elements
    function
    API Testing
    Event testing
    props & state
    UI condition 

Avoid testing for below things
    External UI library 
    no need to test default function of JS

code coverage must be 80%
RTL Query
    find ui element
    find element with id,name,type,testid
    find single element
        getBy
        queryBy
    find Multiple elements
        getAllBy
        queryAllBy
we can also use for loop in tsx file
DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT = 10000 npm test
Testing playground extension
MSW for mockup the api testing suggested from react testing
